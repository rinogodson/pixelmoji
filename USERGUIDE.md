### Templates: Ready-Made Themes for Instant Fun

For instant inspiration, PixeMoji offers a range of Templates that you can use as starting points for your art. Each template transforms the background into a themed scene and adjusts the brush tool to complement the theme.

Here are the templates available:

#### Pirate Theme

Turn your canvas into a sea adventure! The Pirate template sets the background as a blue sea filled with pirate-themed emojis, like ships and treasure chests. Your brush is automatically set to a ship emoji, allowing you to create an exciting ocean voyage.

#### Fire Theme

Transform the background into a vibrant forest scene. With the Fire template, the trees can be ‚Äúburned‚Äù by clicking on them with your brush, creating a dramatic effect.

#### Snow Theme

Step into a winter wonderland with the Snow template. This setting adds snowflake emojis to the grid, and you can summon a rider emoji by clicking on the snow to add a playful touch.

#### Beach Theme

The Beach template captures the essence of summer, with sandy shores and ocean waves. Clicking on the water with your brush tool will introduce a surfer emoji, adding life to your beachy creation.
