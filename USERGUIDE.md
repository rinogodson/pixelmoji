### Here's a guide to the PixeMoji app:

You'll see a background filled with squares, which is where your emojis will be displayed. You can select different emojis by clicking the brush tool and searching for the emoji you want. You can also use the color mode to create pixel arts with raw colors. Additionally, you can select from various templates, including Pirate, Fire, Snow, Beach, and Swimming.

## Brush Tool
The brush tool allows you to select different emojis to use as your brush. You can search for the emoji you want and use it to create your art.

## Color Mode
The color mode allows you to create pixel arts with raw colors. You can adjust the RGB inputs to create the color you want.

## Templates
The templates feature allows you to select from various pre-made templates, including Pirate, Fire, Snow, Beach, and Swimming.

### Pirate
The Pirate template turns the background into a sea scene with ships and other pirate-themed emojis. The brush tool also changes to a ship emoji.

### Fire
The Fire template turns the background into a forest with trees that you can "burn" by clicking on them.

You can change the background by clicking the BG Fill button next to the brush tool. This allows you to change the background to any emoji you want.

# Grid Size
If you're unhappy with the size of the background, you can change it using the Grid Size feature on the left side of the screen. There are two options for grid size: one for changing the height and one for changing the width.

# Clear
If you want to clear the art you've made, click the Clear button on the left side of the screen. Make sure you're done with your art before clearing it.

# Copy
Finally, you can copy your beautiful art to your clipboard by clicking the Copy button next to the Clear button. You can share your art with friends or use it to roast them.

This app allows you to create pixel arts with emojis and is designed to be fun and entertaining. I hope you enjoy using it!
